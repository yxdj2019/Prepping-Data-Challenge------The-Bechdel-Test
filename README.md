# Prepping-Data-Challenge------The-Bechdel-Test

using Python to complete the Preppin' Data Challenge -- The Bechdel Test

This challenge is from Tableau weekly Preppin' Data blog.

The full original data and requirements for data cleaning and prepping can be found: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2022/03/2022-week-10-bechdel-test.html

To deal with the html codes, Pandas methods like Seriers.str.extract and Seriers.replace are used and getting familiar with the use of REGEX is also important (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).
